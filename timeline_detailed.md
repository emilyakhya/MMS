## Risk Analysis & Assumptions

### High-Risk Items
1. **Ethics Approval Delays**: Could delay entire project timeline
2. **Production & Certification**: BPOM, Halal certification delays
3. **Field Worker Recruitment**: Training and deployment challenges
4. **Data Collection**: Field implementation and compliance issues

### Key Assumptions
1. **Timeline**: 30-week project duration (Q1-Q4 2025)
2. **Resources**: Adequate funding and personnel availability
3. **Stakeholder Support**: Continued government and partner engagement
4. **Technology**: AI/ML system development progresses as planned

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Early Ethics Submission**: Submit ethics application immediately
2. **Parallel Processing**: Run preparation activities concurrently
3. **Stakeholder Management**: Regular communication and updates
4. **Contingency Planning**: Buffer time for critical path activities

## Status Tracking

### Current Status Distribution
- **Not Started/Planned**: 38 tasks (79.2%)
- **In Progress (Extended)**: 7 tasks (14.6%)
- **In Progress (Performance)**: 2 tasks (4.2%)
- **Holiday/Break**: 1 task (2.1%)

### Completion Rate: 0.0%

## Next Steps & Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Submit ethics application to University of Mataram
   - Begin protocol finalization with Sight and Life team
   - Initiate partner engagement and MoU discussions

2. **Week 1-4 Priorities**:
   - Complete protocol development
   - Start curriculum building
   - Begin partner engagement

3. **Week 5-8 Priorities**:
   - Complete ethics approval process
   - Finish curriculum and materials
   - Begin system development

4. **Risk Monitoring**:
   - Track ethics approval timeline
   - Monitor stakeholder engagement
   - Assess resource availability
