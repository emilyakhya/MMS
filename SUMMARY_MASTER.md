## User Requirements

• CHPs need a simple, intuitive interface for quickly counting pills without extensive training or technical knowledge.

• Users require offline functionality to perform pill counting tasks when internet connectivity is unreliable or unavailable.

• Administrators need comprehensive dashboards with real-time analytics to monitor patient adherence patterns across multiple facilities.

• Users expect fast, responsive interactions with page load times under 3 seconds even on slower network connections.

• CHPs need the ability to manually override AI detection results when the system makes incorrect pill count assessments.

• Users require secure authentication that maintains their login state across browser sessions without frequent re-authentication.

• Administrators need data export capabilities to generate reports for regulatory compliance and stakeholder presentations.

• Users expect the system to work seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes without requiring app installations.

• CHPs need barcode scanning functionality to quickly identify patients and supplements without manual data entry.

• Users require clear error messages and guidance when system issues occur to maintain confidence in the application.

## Product Requirements

• Automatically count pills in bottle photos using YOLOv8 computer vision with confidence scoring and manual override capability for verification accuracy.

• Deliver a native app-like experience through PWA architecture with offline-first design, eliminating the need for app store installations.

• Support real-time camera barcode scanning for patient/supplement identification with fallback to manual entry for comprehensive coverage.

• Store pill count records locally when offline and automatically sync to the server when connectivity is restored with conflict resolution.

• Provide distinct interfaces for CHPs (simplified pill counting) and Admins (comprehensive analytics dashboard) based on user permissions.

• Display aggregated statistics, advanced filtering options, data export capabilities, and visual analytics for patient adherence patterns.

• Ensure seamless functionality across Chrome desktop and mobile browsers with adaptive layouts and touch-friendly interactions.

• Meet WCAG 2.1 standards for inclusive design, supporting users with disabilities through proper contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility.

• Design simple, clear workflows for pill counting tasks while providing advanced features for administrative oversight and reporting.

• Present complex adherence data through charts, graphs, and trend analysis to help administrators make informed decisions about patient care.

## Functional Requirements

• Implement AI-powered pill detection and counting using computer vision technology with real-time processing capabilities.

• Provide role-based user authentication and authorization with distinct permissions for CHPs and administrators.

• Enable offline data storage and synchronization with conflict resolution when connectivity is restored.

• Support barcode scanning functionality for patient and supplement identification with manual entry fallback.

• Implement manual override capabilities for AI detection results to ensure accuracy and user control.

• Provide comprehensive analytics dashboard with filtering, sorting, and data export functionality.

• Enable real-time camera capture and image processing for pill counting tasks.

• Implement audit logging for all medication-related activities to maintain compliance requirements.

• Support responsive design across multiple device types and screen sizes.

• Provide data backup and recovery mechanisms to ensure data integrity and availability.

## Technical Requirements

• Achieve page load times under 3 seconds on 3G networks, AI processing under 10 seconds per image, and support 100+ concurrent users with 99.5% uptime.

• Enforce HTTPS, implement input validation, prevent SQL injection/XSS attacks, and maintain encrypted storage for HIPAA-compliant data handling.

• Implement secure token-based authentication with distinct permissions for CHPs and Admins, including comprehensive audit logging.

• Utilize service workers for offline functionality, caching strategies, and background synchronization to ensure continuous operation.

• Implement client-side data storage using IndexedDB for offline data persistence and efficient local data management.

• Ensure consistent functionality across Chrome desktop and mobile browsers with responsive design and progressive enhancement.

• Develop RESTful APIs for data exchange between frontend and backend systems with proper error handling and rate limiting.

• Maintain 80% code coverage with automated unit, integration, E2E, performance, security, and accessibility tests across all components.

• Design modular, microservice-ready architecture that can handle increased load and support future feature additions without performance degradation.

• Implement robust conflict resolution and data consistency mechanisms for seamless offline-to-online synchronization with server-side validation.
