- **Impact**: All AI/ML functionality tests failing

#### 3. Missing API Endpoints (35 tests)
- **Issue**: Tests expect endpoints like `/analytics`, `/admin/users`, `/export` that don't exist
- **Root Cause**: Main API implementation is basic for MVP
- **Impact**: All advanced functionality tests failing

#### 4. Response Format Mismatches (5 tests)
- **Issue**: Tests expect specific response formats that differ from actual implementation
- **Root Cause**: API responses include additional fields (e.g., timestamp)

# Update Record model tests to use correct foreign key relationships
```

#### 2. Implement Missing Service Methods
```python
# Add missing methods to PillDetectionService:
# - preprocess_image()
# - count_pills()
# - calculate_confidence_score()
# - process_image()
# - validate_manual_count()
# - create_bounding_boxes()
```

#### 3. Add Missing API Endpoints

# - /admin/users
# - /admin/audit-log
# - /export/csv
# - /export/excel
# - /patients (POST)
# - /supplements (GET/POST)
# - /records (GET/POST)
```

#### 4. Fix Response Format Issues

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Comprehensive keyboard-only testing

## Conclusion

The test update work has successfully established a comprehensive testing infrastructure that aligns with the REQUIREMENT_MASTER.md and TESTING_MASTER.md specifications. The auth service tests are fully functional and provide excellent coverage for authentication and authorization requirements.

The main remaining work involves:
1. **Aligning test expectations with actual implementation** (model fields, service methods, API endpoints)
2. **Implementing missing functionality** to support the comprehensive test suite
3. **Adding performance, security, and accessibility tests** for complete NFR coverage

The foundation is solid, and the test infrastructure is ready to support the full implementation of the AI-Powered Pill Counting PWA System.
