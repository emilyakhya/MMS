### Use Cases

#### Primary Use Case: Pill Counting Workflow
**Actor:** Community Health Promoter (CHP)  
**Preconditions:** CHP is authenticated and has internet connectivity  
**Main Flow:**
1. CHP logs into the PWA
2. CHP navigates to pill counting screen
3. CHP scans patient barcode using camera
4. System validates barcode and retrieves patient information
5. CHP takes photo of pill bottle
6. AI processes image and provides pill count with confidence score
7. CHP reviews AI count and can override if necessary
8. CHP submits record
9. System stores record locally and syncs to server
10. System confirms successful submission

**Alternative Flows:**
- **A1:** No internet connection - record stored offline for later sync
- **A2:** Invalid barcode - system prompts for manual entry
- **A3:** Low AI confidence - system prompts for manual verification
- **A4:** Photo quality issues - system prompts for retake

**Postconditions:** Pill count record is created and stored in system
